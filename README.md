# Hangman! - Vanilla Flavored

## Description
Using the tradional concept of Hangman; a user must guess the word to win the game. In this in this game the user has 6 chances (lives) to miss a letter or they lose the game. If the user correctly guesses the word they win the game.

This game does not use a hanging gallow with a character being produced with each incorrect word. instead there's a "lives" counter to represent each major body part (head, torso, legs and arms).
